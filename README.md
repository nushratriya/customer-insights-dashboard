# My Travel Diary - A Visual Journey

This project is a photographic travel diary that showcases images of the places I've visited, including Dubai, Japan, New York, and Chicago. I used HTML to structure the content and CSS to create a polaroid photo effect for each location. The website also includes a navigation bar that lets you quickly jump to each location, providing an interactive and engaging experience. Additionally, I have integrated Google Analytics to track user interactions and engagement.

## Features

- **CSS Polaroid Photos**: Using CSS, Iâ€™ve created a polaroid-style effect for the images representing the places I've visited (Dubai, Japan, New York, and Chicago).
- **Navigation Bar**: Easy-to-use navigation to explore different parts of the webpage and jump between locations.
- **Google Analytics Integration**: Tracks user interaction and engagement across the site to gather insights about visitors.
- **Responsive Design**: The webpage is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a great user experience across devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structuring the webpage and adding content.
